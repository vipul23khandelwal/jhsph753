========

1. You observe random variables X_1,...,X_n ~ F and you want to estimate the mean. 
2. You know Pr(X_i labeled an outlier and removed | X_i). 
3. What is E[\bar{X} | X_i, outliers removed]?
4. Use the myOutliers function https://github.com/jtleek/jhsph753/blob/master/assignments/myOutliers.R to calculate
the outliers for different distributions (try normal, cauchy, f to start).
5. How does the mean change for different distributions/sample sizes? Do you notice any patterns?
6. [Bonus points/take home] Can you think of a method for theoretically correcting for outliers if you didn't see those values?
7.you can use ML in it.
